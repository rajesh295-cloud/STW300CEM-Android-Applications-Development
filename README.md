# Why do you use the technology you used?
To build a E-mandu app various technology were implemented like a flutter, hot reload, android studio, vs code, MongoDB, Node Js, etc. Flutter is the most promising platform by google, which is used to build visually attractive, fast smartphone apps for both Android and iOS platforms. Hot reload technology helps quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add, features, and fix bugs. Android Studio provides a unified environment where you can build apps. Vs code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations. MongoDB is used as a backend database that offers CRUD operation which is useful for working with large sets of distributed data.
Nodejs
# The challenges faced and features hope to implement in the future.
I hope to use more development dependencies and customs settings also custom UI and authentication implementation where this might be easier in the development process but after applying all the project into authentication, I face lot error where the segment of code is removed while using multiple screen and validations. The changes are turned into custom to template design uses with some screens are customized only. In future in this app or in another project implementation I hope to get some more features in this app where the multiple integration and modern UI with face validation and fingerprint integration as well as payment security with accuracy and fast processing.


# State management
In this E-mandu app I have use the state management library and i.e. Flutter_riverpod to sort out form shifting the page into page and with multiple page it helps and benefits with solving errors and time while solving. This is where to pass data around when you’re navigating, but this quickly becomes unmanageable. So Flutter dependencies to use of Inherited Widget as a way to manage global state. Inherited Widget provides a way to look up the widget tree to find a widget and found state Provider”. Under Widget Testing and UI Testing, all we need to do is supply override values. Here it just supply a mock, to test different scenarios. Because we’re injecting the dependency into repos constructor, then unit testing becomes as simple as injecting the mock during a test.


# MVVM
A Flutter MVVM. It uses property-based data binding to establish a connection between the View Model and the View and drives the View changes through the View Model. A Flutter MVVM (Model-View-View Model) implementation. It is a client-side design pattern. It guides the structure and design of your code to help you achieve “Separation of Concerns.” Implementing MVVM requires a bit of a mind-shift in the way you think about the functionality of your application.

# Conclusion:
In my point of view, flutter is the best option as the learning access will become more friendly and well-organized resources and tutors, whereas the college& flutter project is a path for growth in the future. I wanted to build the “E-Mandu” as  electric products buying and selling through an application which seems wide possibilities I future project development here my first a scalable android application will make a reference and inspiration to build more accurate and cost-efficient app as well as valuable for customer &useful. This project is interesting as my first integration of cashless payment is usable like others deployed applications.
